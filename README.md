# Project Description
Online shopping over the last decade has become a staple in our world. Our goal for this project was to make a clean and very minimalistic website for customers to easily browse, shop and checkout items. 

Our aim was to give customers a series of different shopping items to shop for along with providing variety and quaility. We wanted to make sure our website wasn't narrowed down to just one thing such a tech or clothing, but made it so it has everything so customers have multiple options. Furthermore, creating a secure checkout was at a premium for us as we wanted to make sure we had everything that was essential including shipping information, personal information and card information

As upcoming Software engineers, we had to make sure to intergrate the principles and devlopmental skills we were taught in this course.
